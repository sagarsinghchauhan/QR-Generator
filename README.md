# QR-Generator
Welcome to the Advanced QR Code Generator repository! This Python project allows users to generate customized QR codes with the ability to modify the fill color and background color of the QR code image. It uses the powerful "qrcode" library to create the QR code and "Pillow (PIL)" for image manipulation.
